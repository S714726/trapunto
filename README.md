# Trapunto

Trapunto is a "live" Clojure/ClojureScript/Quil/Processing image generation client & server. Write code that resembles Clojure and Quil on the left, get a rendered image on the right in a decent amount of time. Something like that.

## Usage

After cloning the repository, run

1. `lein deps` to install dependencies
2. `lein cljsbuild once` to build the Clojurescript
3. `lein ring server` to build and run the Clojure server

Check out [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) and [Processing](http://processing.org/) for functions to use, example sketches, fun ideas, and all sorts of cool stuff.
